# tik-tac-toe



curreblty my current thougths on this project lets start with the 

The game Board
    this
    It will have 9 total cells, and it will have a padding around it so that it will have space between each one, there will be a hover option on each cell, 

The objects
    the first one would be the player objects and I think it would just be the name of the player and if there x or O 

    the second object would be a be the gameboard which will be an array storyed insdie an object, am thinking something like left-row-1 is very top left and right row -3 is very bottom right and checking the win ocndition by a simple if these equal each other then say x wins, I think that woiuld be good, equals each otehr and saving time from now running it twice, 

    an object to control the overall flow of teh game, I think the iea would be having a starting position, where it creates the board, the name, and basic start up, the middle phase where it allows the movmetn of the mouse and touchign squares, and after a win/tie /lose, it will go to a third phase whihc will actrually just reset the board, the socre will be tracked and added tothe xcreeen
